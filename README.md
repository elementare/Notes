# 📚 Personal Study Notes

This repository contains my personal notes taken during my journey through various fields of science, technology, and literature.  
Each folder represents an area of interest or a theme I’m actively exploring, either through formal courses, self-study, or research.

These notes are written and organized in a way that helps me consolidate my understanding and reflect on what I learn.  
Most of them are structured using markdown and follow a clean, readable format. You’re welcome to browse and use anything that helps you too!

## 🧠 Purpose

This is a living repository. The goal isn’t perfection, but growth and continuous reflection.  
Sometimes the notes are raw, other times they're polished summaries. Either way, they're snapshots of my thoughts while learning.
